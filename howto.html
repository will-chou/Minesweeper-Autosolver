		<p>
			<strong><em>Objective</em></strong></p>
		<p>
			The objective of minesweeper is to avoid all the mines in the board, and to reveal all the safe squares. &nbsp;The game starts with a grid of cells that either have a hidden mine or is a safe cell. &nbsp;By using logic and probability, the user moves through the grid, revealing free cells and avoiding mines. &nbsp;Once all the safe cells are revealed, the game is won.</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Types of Cells</em></strong></p>
		<p>
			There are five types of cells in minesweeper. &nbsp;To reveal the cells, the user left-clicks the cell he/she wants to reveal.</p>
		<p>
			The first type is the unrevealed cell. &nbsp;A grid of unrevealed cells looks like:</p>
		<p>

		<p>
			The second type is the revealed safe cell. &nbsp;It contains a number, which tells the user how many mines the numbered cell is touching. &nbsp;For example, if the number in the cell is 2, the cell is touching 2 mines. &nbsp;Some revealed safe cells look like:</p>

		<p>
			The third type of cell is the flagged cell. &nbsp;If the user thinks the cell has a hidden mine, he/she can flag the cell by right-clicking on the cell. &nbsp;This is an example of a correctly flagged cell:</p>

		<p>
			The fourth type of cell is a question mark cell. &nbsp;A questino mark is placed on a cell by double-right-clicking the cell when the user is not sure whether the cell is a safe cell or a mine. &nbsp;A question mark cell would look like:</p>

		<p>
			The last type of cell is a mine. &nbsp;If a user reveals a mine cell, the game ends and the user loses. &nbsp;A mine cell looks like:</p>

		<p>
			If the user successfully reveals all the safe mines on the grid, the grid would look like:</p>
